20	This can cause performance degradation	If this value is large, you should consider increasing the value of the sort_buffer_size system variable	3	{'sort_buffer_size'}	[]

22	Take into account that setting this to a higher value will consume a large chunk of your server’s memory	The read_buffer_size system variable determines the buffer size	2	{'read_buffer_size'}	[]
23	In 64-bit platforms, Windows truncates values above 4GB to 4GB-1 with a warning	join_buffer_size	1	{'join_buffer_size'}	['64-bit', '4GB', '4GB-1']
24	A value of 8 or 16 is recommended on systems that routinely use 16 or more cores	The open tables cache can be partitioned into several smaller cache instances of size table_open_cache / table_open_cache_instances	1	{'table_open_cache_instances', 'table_open_cache'}	['8', '16', 'on', '16']
25	This variable must be set to 0 along with query_cache_type = 0 as well to turn it off	This variable must be set to 0 along with query_cache_type = 0 as well to turn it off	4	{'query_cache_type'}	['0', '0', 'off']
26	Since Inno DB relies heavily on the buffer pool, you would consider setting this value typically to 70%-80% of your server’s memory	innodb_buffer_pool_size	0	{'innodb_buffer_pool_size'}	['on', '70%-80%']
27	A recommended value is 2 times the number of CPUs plus the number of disks	innodb_thread_concurrency	4	{'innodb_thread_concurrency'}	['2']
28	I would suggest here to set perhaps 1% of RAM or 256 Mi B at start if you have larger memory and dedicate the remaining memory for your OS cache and Inno DB buffer pool	Inno DB is the default storage engine now of My SQL, the default for key_buffer_size can probably be decreased unless you are using My ISAM productively as part of your application (but who uses My ISAM in production now?)	4	{'key_buffer_size'}	['1%', '256']
29	Value can be set to 0 or OFF to disable logging	slow_query_log	4	{'slow_query_log'}	['0']
30	Setting it to 1 or ON to enable this	slow_query_log	4	{'slow_query_log'}	['1']
31	Alternatively, you can set this to 0 if you want to disable disk synchronization and just rely on the OS to flush the binary log to disk from time to time	sync_binlog	4	{'sync_binlog'}	['0', 'on']
32	Or setting it to a value of 1 as follows	echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*/cpufreq/scaling_governor	2	{'/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*/cpufreq/scaling_governor'}	['1']
